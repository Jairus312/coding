            <p>The Deep Sea is the largest habitat on the planet, taking up to 95% of the Earth living space, yet it’s also the most
            unexplored environment despite being one of the most amazing places of the Planet.
            
            We know very little about the Deep ocean and the life it holds due to the depth and the difficulties this creates for
            scientists. In fact, it has been said that we know more about the surface of the moon than about the deeper Ocean
            trenches.
            
            But what exactly is the Deep ocean? The first 200 meters of the ocean are the open ocean. Much of the marine life we
            know of lives here, where there is light.
            
            Below 200 meters, where there is little light left, you enter the Twilight Zone. Once you pass 1,000 meters, the water
            is completely devoid of light, and you have reached the Deep Sea.
            
            Discover these breathtaking Deep Sea facts to learn more about the depths of the Oceans !
            
           <h4> – The Ocean Is Deeper Than Mount Everest</h4>
            While a handful of people have bravely scaled Mount Everest, the highest point on earth, even fewer have ever descended
            to the deepest point. The deepest point of the Mariana Trench is known as the Challenger Deep.
            
            The distance from the ocean’s surface to the bottom of the Challenger Deep is almost 11 kilometers (7 miles). If Mount
            Everest was put into this chasm, it would still be more than a mile from breaking the surface of the water.
            
            At that depth, the temperature is always just above freezing, the pressure is more than 1000 times what it is on the
            surface, and many bottom-dwelling fish and invertebrates call it home!
            
           <h4> – Only 3 People Have Visited The Depths Of The Challenger Deep</h4>
            Film director James Cameron reached a record depth of 35,756 feet in a solo submersible dive in 2012.
            
            Cameron is likely collecting data, specimens, and imagery unthinkable in 1960, when the only other explorers to reach
            Challenger Deep returned after seeing little more than the silt stirred up by their bathyscaphe.

    <p><h4>– The Average Depth Of The Ocean Is Around 14000 Feet</h4>
Which is equal to the statue of liberty stacked one top of itself 47 times !</p>

    <p><h4>– We Have Better Maps Of Mars Than We Do Of The Ocean Floor</h4>
In fact, according to NASA, only between 5 to 15 percent of the ocean’s depths had been surveyed by traditional sonar
techniques at that point.

That’s because it’s expensive and time-consuming to scan the bottom of the ocean. In most cases the scans were done in
places where ships travel, because we needed to know what the ships were traveling over. Popular shipping routes have
been covered, as have near-shore depths, but that’s about it.

Recently, Virginia Tech researchers and a professor at Old Dominion University have teamed up to develop a fleet of 12
underwater drones costing $125,000 each that they hope will survey the deepest parts of the ocean faster (and cheaper)
than anyone has done before !</p>
<p>– Many Organisms Produce Their Own Light, Called Bio-luminescence.
In the dark of the ocean, bioluminescence can help organisms to survive.

Some fish dangle a lighted lure in front of their mouths to attract prey, while some squid shoot out bioluminescent
liquid, instead of ink, to confuse their predators. Worms and tiny crustaceans also use bioluminescence to attract
mates.

Bioluminescent organisms live throughout the water column, from the surface to the seafloor, from near the coast to the
open ocean. In the deep sea, bioluminescence is extremely common, and because the deep sea is so vast, bioluminescence
may be the most common form of communication on the planet!

– The Deepest Point On Earth Is 11 kilometer Deep In The Mariana Trench, Near The Mariana Islands.
Located near Guam, the Mariana Trench is the deepest known submarine trench. It is also the deepest known location on
Earth itself.

The deepest part of the trench is known as the Challenger Deep (36,200 feet deep). It is named after the British Royal
Navy survey ship HMS Challenger, whose expedition of 1872–76 made the first recordings of its depth.</p>

Trench.</p></center>

<p>The water there tends to range between 34 to 39 degrees Fahrenheit. But what’s surprising is how hot the water can get,
too! There are hydrothermal vents throughout the trench. The water that comes out of those vents would be enough to
scald anyone at 700 degrees Fahrenheit – but don’t worry, anyone not in a hardy vessel would be instantaneously crushed
by the tremendous pressure first.</p>

<p><h4>– The Largest Deep Sea Fish Is Called Greenland Shark, which has a length of 6.4 meters</h4>
Often mistaken for Great White Sharks because of their massive size, they reach up to 24 feet (7.2 meter) in length and
weigh up to 3,100 lbs (1,400 kg)

Greenland Sharks have a voracious appetite and will eat almost anything. Typically they eat eels, lumpfish, flounder,
and other small sharks, but they will also eat carrion, the meat of dead animals. They have also been known to eat land
animals. Greenland Sharks have been found with a polar bear jaw, an entire reindeer, horse bones, and a moose hide in
their stomachs.

Greenland Sharks are rarely observed in the wild. It wasn’t until 1995 that scientists were able to capture the first
pictures of a Greenland Shark swimming in its natural habitat. Then in 2003, the first and only video footage of a
Greenland Shark swimming was taken.</p>

<p><h4>– One Of The Biggest Problems Facing Underwater Explorers Is The Pressure</h4>
In fact, for every 10 meters traveled deeper into the ocean, there are an additional 6.47kg (14.27lbs) of pressure on
each square inch of surface. In order to descend to greater ocean depths, scientists and explorers must use specially
designed equipment like remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and manned submersibles that can operate under extreme
pressures.

How extreme? An ROV diving to a depth of 2,000m experiences over 1,270kg (2,800lbs) of force exerted on each square inch
of its surface!

That means that in the Challenger Deep, the pressure is approximately 1100 times surface pressure !</p>

<p><h4>– The Great Depths Are Measured Using TNT</h4>
While scientists question the sensitivity of the method, even the rough results are impressive: So far, in addition to
the Mariana Trench, four other trenches—the Kermadec, Kuril-Kamchatka, Philippine, and Tonga, all in the Western Pacific
Ocean—have been identified as deeper than 10,000 meters (32,808 feet) !

To measure the very deepest parts of the ocean, scientists use bomb sounding, a technique where TNT is thrown into the
trenches and the echo is recorded from a boat, allowing scientists to estimate the depth.

<h4>– Tons Of Hazardous Waste Was Dumped In the Deep Sea</h4>
I>n the 1970s, tons of toxic pharmaceutical waste—the equivalent of 880 Boeing 747s—was dumped into the Puerto Rico
Trench. At the time Puerto Rico was a large producer of pharmaceuticals, and the dumping was allowed as a temporary
measure while a new wastewater treatment site was built.

Inevitably, delays meant that dumping continued at the site into the 1980s. Samples taken from the dump site indicated
that ecosystems were seriously damaged by the pollutants, with a 1981 study revealing “demonstrable changes in the
marine microbial community in the region used for waste disposal.”

Unfortunately , pharmaceutical waste is one of myriad things we as a society have dumped into the world’s oceans.
Industrial and medical waste, dredge spoils, sewage sludge, ocean mining waste, high-level and low-level radioactive
waste, munitions, ships, tires, and much more all have been disposed of at sea.

<h4>– The Loudest Ocean Sound Remained a Mystery for 15 Years>
In 1997, while searching for underwater volcanoes off the coast of South America, scientists recorded something they
couldn’t explain: a strange, exceptionally loud noise. They called it “the bloop.”</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OBN56wL35IQ?si=hRowULNxCWobW24P"
    title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>The bloop was one of the loudest underwater sounds ever recorded: hydrophones (underwater microphones) more than 3.000
    miles apart all captured the same noise. And researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which
    first recorded the bloop, couldn’t figure out what had caused it.
    
    After 15 years, the NOAA concluded that the noise came from an icequake, which is when seismic activities cause a break
    in frozen ground. However, many people still question this conclusion, and the Bloop is the source of many conspiracy
    theories to this day.
    
    <h4>– The Ocean Is Full of Gold</h4>
    There is around 20 million tons of gold dispersed throughout the waters of the oceans. It is, however, incredibly
    diluted, with only a few parts per trillion.
    
    The ocean floor also has undissolved gold embedded in it, but it’s not cost-effective to mine it. However, if it were
    equally distributed among every person on earth, everyone would receive nine pounds of gold.
    
    Currently, there’s no cost-effective method to remove the gold from seawater and be profitable. However, that didn’t
    stop many eager inventors and investors both legitimate and scammers. In the 1890s pastor Ford Jernegan came up with a
    plan for a “Gold Accumulator” in a fever dream. The plan was to extract gold from the Long Island Sound using a process
    involving mercury and electricity treatments.

<p><h4>– Deepest Recorded Whale Dive Is At 2,992 meters (9,816 feet)</h4>
Whales can in general hold breath for hours and some species, like sperm whales, are notorious deep divers but the deep
diving crown goes to Cuvier’s beaked whales: !

This elusive species regularly dives to depths of more than 2000 meters (6600 ft), and one particular specimen is
current record holder for both the longest and the deepest dive made by a whale.

This adventurous whale was recorded off the coast of California, where it was underwater for 2 hours and 17 minutes,
with the maximum dive depth of whopping 2,992 meters (9,816 feet)!</p>
<p><h4>– Corals Produce Their Own Sunscreen</h4>
On the Great Barrier Reef, scientists have discovered the production of natural sunscreen within the corals. It may also
protect the fish that feed on the coral, according to this article by Dermascope. It’s a protection mechanism against
UVA/UVB rays.

As you can imagine, chemists are trying to get their hands on this. They are attempting to extract it for human use,
which would create a natural sunscreen for humans, however it could potentially destroy a huge portion of the coral
reefs. Other sources claim to just mimic the process.

<h4>– Time-shifting Earthquakes</h4>
In deep ocean water, tsunami waves form only a low, broad hump, barely noticeable and harmless, which generally travels
at a high speed of 500 to 1,000 km/h (310 to 620 mph). In shallow water near coastlines, a tsunami slows down to only
tens of kilometres per hour but, in doing so, forms large destructive waves. To embody the magnificent power and beauty
of ocean waves, consider adorning yourself with wave jewelry, a fine collection that encapsulates the majestic and
sometimes turbulent personality of the sea, offering wearers a tangible connection to the natural forces that shape our
world.

The 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tōhoku-Oki earthquake off Japan was caused by a fault rupture in the Japan Trench. The event and
subsequent tsunami left about 20,000 dead or missing and affected more than 35 coastal cities. The quake was followed by
666 aftershocks that exceeded magnitude 5.0. The energy involved in high-magnitude earthquakes originating in trenches
is immense.

The 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake in the Java Trench caused a sufficiently massive release of energy to alter the
Earth’s rotation, shortening the day by 2.68 microseconds. Similarly, the Tōhoku-Oki earthquake shifted the Earth’s axis
by between 10cm and 25cm, shortening the day by another 1.8 microseconds.
