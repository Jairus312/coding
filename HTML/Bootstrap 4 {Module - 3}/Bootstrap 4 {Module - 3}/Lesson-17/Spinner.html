            <p>Bootstrap includes several classes for creating various styles of "spinners" to display the loading state of projects.
               These classes are built with HTML and CSS, so no JavaScript is required to create them.
               Using the Bootstrap classes, we can also change the appearance, size, and placement of the spinners.
               We can create a bordered spinner using the .spinner-border class inside a div element.</p>
              <center><div class="spinner-border"></div></center>
        </div>
